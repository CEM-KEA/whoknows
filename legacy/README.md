# Â¿Who Knows? - Flask Application

A legacy search engine built in 2009, now ported to Python 3 and using more modern Flask versions! This project demonstrates how to modernize and work with older Python applications while maintaining backwards compatibility.

**Note**: This application is still intentionally full of problems and vulnerabilities for educational purposes. **Do not run this in a production environment**.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- SQLite (for local database use)
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

## Installation

It is highly recommended to use a **virtual environment** to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the necessary dependencies:
    
```bash
make install
```
This will create the virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

## Database Setup
To initialize a new database, run:

```bash
make init
```

This will create the SQLite database (whoknows.db) based on the schema provided in schema.sql.

**Note**: This will delete any existing data in the database.
**Note**: If you make changes to the database schema, you'll need to re-run make init.

## Running the Application
To start the development server on port 8080, run:
    
```bash
make run
```

Alternatively, you can run the application directly using:

```bash
python3 legacy/src/backend/app.py
```

**Note**: Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running the application.

## Tests
To run the tests, use:

```bash
make test
```
Or run the tests directly using:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Development Notes
- This application was originally built using Python 2.7 and Flask 0.5, but it has been ported to work with Python 3 and the latest Flask versions.
- Security Warning: This application contains intentional security flaws for educational purposes. Avoid using this in any real-world environment.
- The database is set up using SQLite. You can find the schema in legacy/db/schema.sql.
- The project structure has been refactored to separate the application code from the configuration and testing components.

## Windows Users
Windows does not natively support Make. If you are using Windows, you can manually run the corresponding commands. For example, instead of make init, you would run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"
```
